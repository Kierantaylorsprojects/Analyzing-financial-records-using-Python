# Analyzing-financial-records-using-Python

   ## Summary
   
In this project I went through and edited two seprate data sets using Python.

More specifically, we looked at profits and losses for a company in relationship to date. We also looked at candidates votes in relationship to county and voter ID. 

Some of the key measurements for the first data set where, the total number of months in the data set, the net total amount of profit and losses, the average change of the profit and losses over a period of time, the greatest increase in profits and the greatest decrease. 

Some of the key measurements for the second data set where, total number of votes cast,a complete list of candidates, the percentage of votes each candidate won and the winner of the election based on popular vote.
