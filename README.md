# Analyzing_financial_records_using_Python

   ## Summary
   
In this project, I went through and edited two separate data sets using Python.

More specifically, I looked at profits and losses for a company to date. We also looked at candidates' votes to county and voter ID. 

Some of the key measurements for the first data set were, the total number of months in the data set, the net total amount of profit and losses, the average change of the profit and losses over a period of time, the greatest increase in profits, and the greatest decrease. 

Some of the key measurements for the second data set were the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
